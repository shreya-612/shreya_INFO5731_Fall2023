Its foundation is the notion that sentences can be disassembled into ever-tinier components, like words, phrases, and clauses. The top-level ingredient, usually the sentence itself, is the root of the tree. The lower-level elements are represented by the other nodes in the tree, which are connected to the root node by edges.\n",

Usually the verb, the root word is the most autonomous word in the sentence."
