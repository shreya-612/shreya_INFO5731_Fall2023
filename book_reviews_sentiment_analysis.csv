1,"Minalima's interactive papercraft is always beautiful, but the Grim being uncovered in the teacup and the moving footsteps on the Marauder's map were absolutely brilliant creative details.  My photo is of the ""Monster's Book of Monsters"" but my favorite details were actually the seasonal detailed edges for Halloween and Christmas.  I already have the original HP books in hardcover, kindle, audible, and the first five art books done by Jim Kay and I still HAVE to buy these MinaLima versions because they are magical.  They remind me of the original images at the start of each chapter and encapsulate the way I imagined the Wizarding World to be before the movies and the other art that came out later.  Absolutely stunning addition to my shelf and I am already looking forward to the next one.  This will be used primarily by an adult but I have let children (9-13) read and use my MinaLima versions and have never had an issue.  They are careful children though, who take care of things.",positive

71,"Minalima's interactive papercraft is always beautiful, but the Grim being uncovered in the teacup and the moving footsteps on the Marauder's map were absolutely brilliant creative details.  My photo is of the ""Monster's Book of Monsters"" but my favorite details were actually the seasonal detailed edges for Halloween and Christmas.  I already have the original HP books in hardcover, kindle, audible, and the first five art books done by Jim Kay and I still HAVE to buy these MinaLima versions because they are magical.  They remind me of the original images at the start of each chapter and encapsulate the way I imagined the Wizarding World to be before the movies and the other art that came out later.  Absolutely stunning addition to my shelf and I am already looking forward to the next one.  This will be used primarily by an adult but I have let children (9-13) read and use my MinaLima versions and have never had an issue.  They are careful children though, who take care of things.",positive

141,Another wonderfully illustrated pop-up book by MinaLima.  I was so happy with the first two books and got this 3rd one on my birthday.  What a grand treat.  Hats off to them for their beautiful and creativity imaginative illustrations.Book arrived shrink wrapped and in excellent condition.  Definitely a must have for Harry Potter fans and book collectors.,positive
142,I always look forward to these books coming out and was so happy to get mine right on time with my pre-order. The illustrations and features throughout the book are so amazing! I buy these books for myself because I love HP - but these versions definitely take your reading experience to a new level and I am excited to read these with my kids so they can enjoy all the fun illustrations and pop ups while we read.,positive
143,"The Mina Lima designs are absolutely stunning! This book is by far my absolute favorite! The artwork and the attention to detail, and all of the graphic design throughout this book is amazing! From the exterior cover to all of the small little details inside this is definitely want to have your collection",positive
144,"Gorgeous book with high quality, vibrantly printed pages and fun pop-out elements for an immersive experience. I've been waiting almost a year for this to come out and it did not disappoint!! I collect Harry Potter books, and I‚Äôm proud to add this to my library ‚ù§Ô∏è",positive

I already have the original HP books in hardcover, kindle, audible, and the first five art books done by Jim Kay and I still HAVE to buy these MinaLima versions because they are magical.  They remind me of the original images at the start of each chapter and encapsulate the way I imagined the Wizarding World to be before the movies and the other art that came out later.  Absolutely stunning addition to my shelf and I am already looking forward to the next one.  This will be used primarily by an adult but I have let children (9-13) read and use my MinaLima versions and have never had an issue.

213,Another wonderfully illustrated pop-up book by MinaLima.  I was so happy with the first two books and got this 3rd one on my birthday.  What a grand treat.  Hats off to them for their beautiful and creativity imaginative illustrations.Book arrived shrink wrapped and in excellent condition.  Definitely a must have for Harry Potter fans and book collectors.,positive
214,I always look forward to these books coming out and was so happy to get mine right on time with my pre-order. The illustrations and features throughout the book are so amazing! I buy these books for myself because I love HP - but these versions definitely take your reading experience to a new level and I am excited to read these with my kids so they can enjoy all the fun illustrations and pop ups while we read.,positive
215,"The Mina Lima designs are absolutely stunning! This book is by far my absolute favorite! The artwork and the attention to detail, and all of the graphic design throughout this book is amazing! From the exterior cover to all of the small little details inside this is definitely want to have your collection",positive
216,"Gorgeous book with high quality, vibrantly printed pages and fun pop-out elements for an immersive experience. I've been waiting almost a year for this to come out and it did not disappoint!! I collect Harry Potter books, and I‚Äôm proud to add this to my library ‚ù§Ô∏è",positive
217,"Like the first two, this book is wonderfully done. I love that, in addition to the interactive inserts, each page has at least ornamental decorations, and most pages even have a painting on it.

221,"Minalima's interactive papercraft is always beautiful, but the Grim being uncovered in the teacup and the moving footsteps on the Marauder's map were absolutely brilliant creative details.  My photo is of the ""Monster's Book of Monsters"" but my favorite details were actually the seasonal detailed edges for Halloween and Christmas.  I already have the original HP books in hardcover, kindle, audible, and the first five art books done by Jim Kay and I still HAVE to buy these MinaLima versions because they are magical.  They remind me of the original images at the start of each chapter and encapsulate the way I imagined the Wizarding World to be before the movies and the other art that came out later.  Absolutely stunning addition to my shelf and I am already looking forward to the next one.  This will be used primarily by an adult but I have let children (9-13) read and use my MinaLima versions and have never had an issue.  They are careful children though, who take care of things.",positive
